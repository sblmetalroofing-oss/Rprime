# Bug Report: API Failures in Production

## Summary
Over the last 7 days, 5 API failure events were logged. These failures are concentrated around two endpoints:
1. `/api/items/fa766a48-4811-4125-9347-f1070667f54a` (404 error)
2. `/api/items/69d3cc76-1ea5-4632-b688-3caa9b4d3d95` (500 error)

The 500 errors are repeated multiple times for the same endpoint and appear to be related to item deletion functionality.

## Patterns Observed
- **Endpoint-Specific:** All errors occurred on `/api/items` endpoints.
- **Severity Concentration:** 4 out of 5 events are `error` severity (500 status), indicating critical backend issues.
- **Device Consistency:** All events were triggered by users on Windows 10 using Chrome 144.0.0.0.
- **Time-Based Clustering:** The 500 errors occurred within a short time frame (02:46:04 - 02:46:41 UTC), suggesting a possible batch operation or repeated user action.

---

## Prioritization
### Critical
- **API 500 Error: `/api/items/69d3cc76-1ea5-4632-b688-3caa9b4d3d95`**
  - **Impact:** Prevents item deletion functionality, potentially causing data integrity issues.
  - **Frequency:** 4 occurrences within seconds.
  - **Action:** Immediate investigation and resolution required.

### Medium
- **API 404 Error: `/api/items/fa766a48-4811-4125-9347-f1070667f54a`**
  - **Impact:** Item not found error may indicate missing or incorrectly referenced data.
  - **Frequency:** 1 occurrence.
  - **Action:** Verify if the item ID is valid and ensure proper error handling for missing resources.

## Actionable Tasks
### Task 1: Investigate and Fix 500 Errors on `/api/items/69d3cc76-1ea5-4632-b688-3caa9b4d3d95`
- **Steps:**
  1. Check backend logs for `/api/items/69d3cc76-1ea5-4632-b688-3caa9b4d3d95` during the error timeframe (02:46:04 - 02:46:41 UTC).
  2. Analyze the deletion logic for potential issues (e.g., database constraints, missing dependencies).
  3. Add defensive coding practices to handle unexpected failures gracefully.
  4. Write unit tests to simulate deletion scenarios and ensure robustness.
  5. Deploy fix and monitor for recurrence.

### Task 2: Verify 404 Error on `/api/items/fa766a48-4811-4125-9347-f1070667f54a`
- **Steps:**
  1. Confirm if the item ID `fa766a48-4811-4125-9347-f1070667f54a` exists in the database.
  2. Investigate whether the item was deleted or never created.
  3. Ensure the frontend handles 404 errors gracefully by displaying appropriate user feedback.
  4. Add logging to capture more context for future 404 errors.

## Recommendations
- **Monitoring:** Set up alerts for repeated 500 errors on `/api/items` endpoints to catch similar issues early.
- **Logging Improvements:** Enhance API logging to include detailed stack traces and user actions leading to errors.
- **Testing:** Perform regression testing on `/api/items` endpoints, focusing on deletion and retrieval functionality.

---

## Notes
- **Device-Specific:** All errors were triggered by users on Windows 10 with Chrome 144.0.0.0. Consider testing on this configuration to replicate the issue.
- **Time-Based:** The clustering of 500 errors suggests a potential batch operation or automated process triggering failures. Investigate if this aligns with backend workflows.
