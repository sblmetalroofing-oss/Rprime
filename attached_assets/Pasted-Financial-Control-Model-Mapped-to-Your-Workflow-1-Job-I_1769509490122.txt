Financial Control Model Mapped to Your Workflow

1. Job Intake → No Money Moves Yet

Purpose: Opportunity validation

Financial rules
	•	Job logged with:
	•	Client
	•	Site
	•	Job type
	•	Est. value range
	•	No costs committed
	•	No scheduling promises
	•	No supplier contact

Control
✔ Prevents premature spend
✔ Keeps WIP clean

⸻

2. Quoting → Margin Locked Before Approval

Purpose: Price discipline

Quote must include
	•	Materials (supplier A / B split)
	•	Subcontract labour
	•	Overheads allocation (fixed %)
	•	Minimum margin threshold (non-negotiable)

Hard rule

If margin < target → quote cannot be sent

Money discipline
	•	Quote value defines:
	•	Required deposit
	•	Cash-in timeline
	•	Expected profit

⸻

3. Schedule Work → Deposit Trigger

Purpose: Cash protection

Before scheduling
	•	Deposit received (usually 30–50%)
	•	Deposit clears bank

Deposit allocation
	•	GST skimmed immediately
	•	Net deposit split:
	•	Materials provision
	•	Labour provision
	•	Tax buffer

Rule

No deposit = no date

This single rule eliminates 80% of cash-flow pain.

⸻

4. Check Measure → Cost Validation Gate

Purpose: Prevent cost blowouts

Before issuing POs
	•	Final dimensions confirmed
	•	Material quantities locked
	•	Subcontract scope signed off

Money control
	•	Updated job cost forecast
	•	Margin rechecked
	•	Any variance approved by director

If margin drops below tolerance → pause job

⸻

5. Orders (POs) → Money Commits Here

Purpose: Controlled spend

PO rules
	•	Every supplier & subcontractor:
	•	Must have a PO
	•	Must reference job number
	•	PO total ≤ allocated job budget

Payment rule
	•	Suppliers paid from materials bucket
	•	Subs paid from labour bucket
	•	Never from general cash

This keeps your accounts explainable under audit.

⸻

6. Work in Progress → Cash vs Progress Tracked

Purpose: Stop silent losses

Weekly checks
	•	% complete vs % invoiced
	•	Labour cost vs allowance
	•	Materials received vs ordered

Red flag

Job >70% complete but <70% invoiced

That’s a cash flow alarm.

⸻

7. Quality Check → Final Invoice Authority

Purpose: Protect final payment

Before QC sign-off
	•	All variations documented
	•	All defects closed
	•	Compliance photos stored

Money rule

No QC sign-off = no final invoice

This avoids disputes and withheld payments.

⸻

8. Close Out → Profit Becomes Real

Purpose: Turn paper profit into banked profit

After final payment
	•	Confirm:
	•	All suppliers paid
	•	All subs paid
	•	GST allocated
	•	Remaining balance → Profit Reserve

Rule

Profit only exists after job close-out

⸻

Your Weekly Money Rhythm (Tied to This Model)

Every Friday:
	1.	Jobs scheduled next 14 days → deposits confirmed
	2.	WIP jobs → % complete vs % invoiced
	3.	Outstanding POs vs cash on hand
	4.	Tax account balance vs liabilities
	5.	Profit reserve movement

This takes 30 minutes if the workflow is followed.

⸻

Account Structure That Supports This Model

Minimum accounts:
	1.	Operating Account
	2.	Materials Account
	3.	Labour / Subcontractor Account
	4.	GST & PAYG Account
	5.	ATO Payment Plan Account
	6.	Profit Reserve
	7.	Director Salary Account

Money moves by rule, not emotion.

⸻

Why This Model Works for You Specifically
	•	Prevents overspending before cash is received
	•	Stops margin erosion mid-job
	•	Makes ATO obligations predictable
	•	Scales to multiple crews without chaos
	•	Protects you personally as director

⸻

Next Step (Highly Recommended)

I can:
	•	turn this into a one-page financial SOP
	•	map it directly into your CRM / job app (statuses + money triggers)
	•	define who approves what (admin vs estimator vs director)
